To demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics. 2. To apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems. 3. To develop problem -solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics. 4. To be able to carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems. 5. To be able to carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments. Brightspace: The class will use Brightspace for class announcements and all lectures will be posted there. If the course needs to go remote (due to a weather cancellation, for instance) the lectures will be given asynchronously on Brightspace. This course will be taught in person (besides any possible weather related cancellations).
