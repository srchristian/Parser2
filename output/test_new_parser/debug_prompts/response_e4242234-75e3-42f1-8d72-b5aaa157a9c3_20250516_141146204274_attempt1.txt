Register for one of 000x sections for laboratory, and one of R0x sections for recitation.\n\nMake-up Labs\n- You must complete every one of the seven experiments. Otherwise, you will receive zero points for the experiments missed. If you have a legitimate reason to miss a laboratory session, you may ask in advance permission from the TA to participate in another laboratory section. There will be only one make-up lab available at the end of the semester.\n\nTentative Laboratory Schedule:\nExperiment\tWeek\nIntro lab\t9/9-13\n1. Motion in 1D (free fall)\t9/16-20\n1.
