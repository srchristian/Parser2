When they go to the login page, they simply click the box saying \"ENTER CLASS KEY\".\nYou will have 5 chances to submit your homework solutions before the due date.\nAfter the due date, a 4 day extension with a 10 point penalty can be selected in WebAssign (available once only per assignment - and must be selected 4 days after the assignment is due).\nIn WebAssign each student gets a different set of numbers in the problems, so the answers will be different.\nTry logging on well before the first assignment due date and become familiar with the WebAssign system. There is a 2-week (free) grace period for you to get started.\n\nLABORATORY:\nA lab manual must be purchased either in advance or at the first lab meeting.

Register for one of 000x sections for laboratory, and one of R0x sections for recitation.\nMake-up Labs: You must complete every one of the seven experiments. Otherwise, you will receive zero points for the experiments missed. If you have a legitimate reason to miss a laboratory session, you may ask in advance permission from the TA to participate in another laboratory section. There will be only one make-up lab available at the end of the semester.\n\nTentative Laboratory Schedule\nYou will be conducting seven experiments. See specific dates below:\nExperiment Week\nIntro lab 9/9-13\n1.Motion in 1D (free fall) 9/16-20\n1.Motion in one 1D (analysis) 9/23-27\n2.Motion in 2D (projectiles) 9/30-10/4\n2.Motion in 2D (analysis) 10/7-11\n3.Newton's laws 10/14-18\n4.Conservation of Energy 10/21-25\n5.Collisions (expt.) 10/28-11/1\n5.Collisions (anal.) 2 weeks 11/4-15\n6.Ballistic Pendulum 11/18-22\nNo labs 11/25-29\n7.Rotational dynamics 12/2-12/6\nMake-up Lab (Pendulum) 12/12 (Reading Day)\n\nThe letter grade for PHY273 lab will be calculated as below.

There is no separate letter grade for the recitation of PH273.\nYou must correctly solve 3 problems in each recitation to get full credit for the section. Solving more than 3 problems will count for missed problems in previous recitation meetings.",
