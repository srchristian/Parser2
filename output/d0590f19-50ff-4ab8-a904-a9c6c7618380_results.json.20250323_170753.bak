        "Additional": "Course Description:\nCalculus-based introduction to Newtonian mechanics. Topics include kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion.\n\nPrerequisites:\nCredit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and PHY 273.\n\nIntended for:\nScience and engineering majors.\n\nTextbook:\nUniversity Physics (OpenStax), 1st Edition, Volume 1 Available for free at [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects/science).\n\nCourse Goals:\n1. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of kinematics.\n2. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of forces.\n3. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of work, energy, and energy conservation.\n4. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of linear momentum and linear momentum conservation.\n5. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of rotational kinematics, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum conservation.\n6. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of oscillations and simple harmonic motion.\n\nGeneral Education Areas:\nThis course satisfies URI's general education areas: \"Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines\" (Full); and \"Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies\" (Partial).\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. Demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics.\n2. Apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems.\n3. Develop problem-solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics.\n4. Carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems.\n5. Carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments.",
