Kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion.\n\nPrerequisites: Credit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and concurrent enrollment in PHY 273.\n\nIntended for: Science and engineering majors.\n\nTextbook: University Physics (Open Stax), 1st Edition, Volume 1. Available for free at https://openstax.org/subjects/science.\n\nCourse Goals:\n1. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of kinematics.\n2. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of forces.\n3. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of work, energy, and energy conservation.\n4. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of linear momentum and linear momentum conservation.\n5. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of rotational kinematics, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum conservation.\n6. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of oscillations and simple harmonic motion.\n\nGeneral Education Areas:\n- Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines (Full)\n- Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies (Partial)\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. Demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics.\n2. Apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems.\n3. Develop problem-solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics.\n4. Carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems.\n5. Carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments.\n\nBrightspace: The class will use Brightspace for announcements and all lectures will be posted there. If the course needs to go remote (e.g., due to weather cancellations), lectures will be available asynchronously on Brightspace on November 25th, 27th, and December 2nd.",
  
  "schedule": "Lecture Times: MWF 1:00pm - 1:50pm (Section 1)\nLocation: East Hall Auditorium\n\nOffice Hours: MWF 12:30pm - 1:00pm\nLocation: 211 East Hall\n\nRemote Lectures: If the course goes remote, lectures will be available asynchronously on Brightspace on November 25th, 27th, and December 2nd.",
  
  "assignments": "Homework Assignments: A set of homework problems will be due on or before (usually Wednesdays or Fridays) of almost every week by 10:00pm. Assignments will be administered through WebAssign.\n\nWebAssign Details:\n- Access and purchase at http://webassign.net/student.html\n- Class Key: uri1373 1043\n- Enrollment: Students will enroll with the class key, creating their own user IDs and passwords. Click 'ENTER CLASS KEY' on the login page.\n- Submission Policy:\n  - 5 chances to submit homework solutions before the due date.\n  - After the due date, a 4-day extension with a 10-point penalty can be selected once per assignment.\n  - Each student receives a different set of numbers in problems.\  - 2-week free grace period for starting.\n\nRecitation: All students must register for a recitation section of PHY273. Recitations will be held in Room 112. Correctly solving 3 problems in each recitation is required for full credit.\n\nHomework and Recitations are part of the course grade, contributing up to 400 points for homework and 250 points for recitation.",
  
  "exams": "Examinations:\n- Three unit exams and a cumulative final exam.\n- All exams are closed book; no other resources allowed.\n- Calculators are permitted.\n- Formula Sheets:\n  - Unit Exams: 1 sheet of relevant formulas each.\n  - Final Exam: 3 sheets of formulas.\n\nExam Dates and Contents:\n- Exam #1: Friday, September 27th | Chapters 1, 3, 4\n- Exam #2: Friday, October 25th | Chapters 5-8\n- Exam #3: Wednesday, December 11th | Chapters 9-11, 15\n- Final Exam: To Be Announced | Comprehensive coverage of Chapters 1-11, 15\n\nFinal Exam Policy: The final exam consists of three parts, each corresponding to a unit exam. If a score on a part of the final exam is higher than the corresponding unit exam score, it replaces the unit exam score in the semester grade calculation. Lower scores on the final do not replace unit exam scores.\n\nNote: If the course goes remote, the exam schedule and grading scheme may be modified.",
