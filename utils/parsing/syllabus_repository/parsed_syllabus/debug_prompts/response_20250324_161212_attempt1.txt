  "exams": "Examinations:\nThere will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All exams are closed book and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You will be allowed to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam and 3 sheets for the final.\n\nExam Schedule:\n- Exam #1 (Chaps. 1, 3, 4): Fri., Sep. 27\n- Exam #2 (Chaps. 5-8): Fri., Oct. 25\n- Exam #3 (Chaps. 9-11, 15): Wed., Dec. 11\n- Final Exam (Chaps. 1-11, 15): TBA\n\nFinal Exam Policy:\nThe final exam will consist of 3 parts, each corresponding to the 3 unit exams above. If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit exam score when your semester grade is calculated. However, the scores of the final are not replaced if they are lower than the scores of the unit exams.\n\nNote:\nIf the course has to go remote during the semester, the exam schedule and grading scheme may be modified.",
