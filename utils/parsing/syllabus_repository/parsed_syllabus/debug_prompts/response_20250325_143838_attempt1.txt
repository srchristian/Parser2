Kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion. (Lec. 3)\nPre-requisites: credit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and concurrent enrollment in PHY 273. Intended for science and engineering majors.\nText: University Physics (OpenStax), 1st Edition, Volume 1, free open access textbook available at https://openstax.org/subjects/science.\nCourse Goals: \n1. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of kinematics.\n2. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of forces.\n3. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of work, energy, and energy conservation.\n4. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of linear momentum and linear momentum conservation.\n5. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of rotational kinematics, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum conservation.\n6. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of oscillations and simple harmonic motion.\nGeneral Education Areas: This course satisfies URI's general education areas: \"Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines\" (Full); and \"Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies\" (Partial).\nLearning Outcomes: \n1. To demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics.\n2. To apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems.\n3. To develop problem-solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics.\n4. To be able to carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems.\n5. To be able to carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments.\nBrightspace: The class will use Brightspace for class announcements and all lectures will be posted there.",

  "exams": "Examinations: There will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All exams are closed book and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You will be allowed to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam and 3 sheets for the final.\nUnit Exams:\n- Unit #1 Chaps. 1,3,4 exam on Fri. 09/27\n- Unit #2 Chaps. 5-8 exam on Fri. 10/25\n- Unit #3 Chaps. 9-11,15 exam on Wed., 12/11\nFinal Exam: Chaps. 1-11,15 TBA\nThe final exam will consist of 3 parts each corresponding to the 3 unit exams above. If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit exam score when your semester grade is calculated.",
