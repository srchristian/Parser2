  "course_info": "PHY203: ELEMENTARY PHYSICS I (Fall 2024)\n\nInstructor: Miquel Dorca\nOffice: 211 East Hall\nEmail: miquel@uri.edu\nOffice Hours: MWF 12:30pm - 1:00pm\n\nLecture Times: 1pm - 1:50pm (Section 1)\nLocation: East Hall Auditorium\n\nCourse Description:\nCalculus-based introduction to Newtonian mechanics. Kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion.\n\nPrerequisites:\nCredit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and PHY 273. Intended for science and engineering majors.\n\nTextbook:\nUniversity Physics (Open Stax), 1st Edition, Volume 1. Available for free at https://openstax.org/subjects/science.\n\nCourse Goals:\n1. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of kinematics.\n2. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of forces.\n3. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of work, energy, and energy conservation.\n4. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of linear momentum and linear momentum conservation.\n5. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of rotational kinematics, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum conservation.\n6. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of oscillations and simple harmonic motion.\n\nGeneral Education Areas:\nThis course satisfies URI's general education areas: \"Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines\" (Full); and \"Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies\" (Partial).\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n1. To demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics.\n2. To apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems.\n3. To develop problem-solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics.\n4. To be able to carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems.\n5. To be able to carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments.\n\nBrightspace:\nThe class will use Brightspace for class announcements and all lectures will be posted there. If the course needs to go remote (due to a weather cancellation, for instance), the lectures will be given asynchronously on Brightspace. This course will be taught in person (besides any possible weather-related cancellations). However, if there are no further notices, the course will be given asynchronously on Brightspace on the following three dates: November 25th, 27th, December 2nd.",
