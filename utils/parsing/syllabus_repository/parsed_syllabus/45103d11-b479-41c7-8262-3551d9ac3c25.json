Kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion. Pre-requisites: credit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and concurrent enrollment in PHY 273. Intended for science and engineering majors. Text: University Physics (Open Stax), 1st Edition, Volume 1. University Physics from OpenStax is a free, open access textbook that can be found at https://openstax.org/subjects/science. Course Goals: 1. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of kinematics. 2. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of forces. 3. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of work, energy, and energy conservation. 4. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of linear momentum and linear momentum conservation. 5. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of rotational kinematics, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum conservation. 6. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of oscillations and simple harmonic motion. Brightspace: The class will use Brightspace for class announcements and all lectures will be posted there. General Education Areas: This course satisfies URI's general education areas: 'Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines' (Full); and 'Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies' (Partial).",

    "assignments": "Homework Assignments: A set of homework problems will be due on or before (usually Wednesdays or Fridays) of almost every week (by 10 p.m.) and will be administered through a web-based system called WebAssign. WebAssign: Homework must be submitted to WebAssign by 10 p.m. of the date due. 5 chances are allowed per assignment. After the due date, a 4-day extension with a 10-point penalty can be selected in WebAssign (available once only per assignment).

    "exams": "Examinations: There will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All exams are closed book and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You will be allowed to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam and 3 sheets for the final. A unit exam will be given at the end of each of the first three-course units. Unit Exam #1: Fri. 09/27 (Chaps. 1,3,4) Unit Exam #2: Fri. 10/25 (Chaps. 5-8) Unit Exam #3: Wed., 12/11 (Chaps. 9-11,15) Final Exam: Chaps. 1-11,15 TBA If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit exam score when your semester grade is calculated.",
