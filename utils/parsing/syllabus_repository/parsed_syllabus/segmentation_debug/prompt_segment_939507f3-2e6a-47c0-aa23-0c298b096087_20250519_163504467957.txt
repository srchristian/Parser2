1.  **Complete and Accurate Extraction:** Preserve all specific details: dates, times, names, locations, policies, ISBNs, links, etc.
2.  **Comprehensive Coverage:** Extract all relevant text for each module. If content seems to fit multiple modules, choose the most specific one or the one where it's most emphasized. Avoid duplicating large chunks of text across modules unless absolutely necessary for context.
3.  **Strict JSON Output:** Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or markdown formatting outside the JSON structure. Ensure correct JSON syntax, especially for strings (e.g., escape internal quotes if necessary, use double quotes for keys and string values).
4.  **Text Formatting:** Preserve original line breaks within the extracted text for each module where it aids readability (e.g., in schedules, lists of policies). Represent newlines as `\n` in the JSON strings.

Brightspace:  
 
The class will use Brightspace  for class announcements  and all lectures will be posted 
there. If the course needs to go remote (due to a weather cancellation, for instance) the 
lectures will be given asynchronously on Brightspace.  
 
This course will be taught in person (besides any possible weather related 
cancellations). However, if there are no further notices, the course will be given 
asynchronously on Brightspace  on the following three  dates:  
November  25th, 27th, 
December  2nd  
 
 
 
Examinations:  There will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All  exams 
are closed book  and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You 
will be allowed  to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam 
and 3 sheets for the final. A unit exam will be given at the end of each of the first three 
course units. The dates and times are listed below.  
 
Course Units:   The course is divide d into three units as follows:  
unit #1        Chaps. 1,3,4       exam on Fri.      09/27  
unit #2        Chaps. 5 -8        exam on Fri.      10/25  
unit #3        Chaps. 9 -11,15  exam on Wed .,  12/11  
Final Exam     Chaps. 1 -11,15   tba  
 
Final Exam : The final exam will consist of 3 parts each corresponding to the 3 unit 
exams above. If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the 
corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit 
exam score when your semester grade is calculated. However, the scores of the final 
are not replaced if they are lower than the scores  of the unit exams . 
 
**If the course has to go remote during the semester, the exam schedule and grading 
scheme may be modified .** 
 
Homework Assignments: A set of homework problems will be due on or before 
(usually Wednesdays or Fridays) of almost every week ( by 10 p.m. ) and will be 
administered through a web -based system called WebAssign (see below).  
 
Course Grade:  
The grade for PHY203 will be based on a maximum of 1200 points :  
unit exams    400 points  
final exam    400 points  
homework    150 points  
recitation    250 points  
 
Grading Scheme :  
A(93 -100); A -(90-93); B+(87 -90); B(83 -87); B -(80-83); C+(77 -80); C(73 -77); 
C-(70-73); D+(67 -70); D(60 -67); F(<60).  
 
WebAssign:  
Homework and recitations will be administered through a web -based service named 
WebAssign.  
WebAssign can be accessed and purchased at http://webassign.net/student.html  The 
Class Key for WebAssign for this course is:  uri 1373 1043  
 
A recent check showed that it was cheaper to purchase Webassign/Openstax for 2 
semesters, since it will be used for PHY204 as well.  
 
Here’s a specific link to openstax/webassign:

 Students will  enroll with this class key, creating their own user IDs and 
password. When they go to the login page, they simply click the box 
saying "ENTER CLASS KEY".  
 You will have 5 chances  to submit your homework solutions before the 
due date.  
 After the due date, a 4 day  extension with a 10 point penalty  can be 
selected in WebAssign (available once only per assignment -and must be 
selected 4 days  after  the assignment is due ). 
 In WebAssign  each student gets a different set of numbers in the 
problems, so the answers will be different.  
 Try logging on well before the first assignment due date and become 
familiar with the WebAssign system. There is a 2 -week (free) grace 
period  for you to get s tarted.  
Recitation:  
 All students must also register for a recitation section of PHY273. 
Separate enrollment is required . 
 The recitations will be held in Room 112.  
 Your recitation grade will be counted toward your PHY203 grade up to a 
maximum of 250 points . There is no separate letter grade for the 
recitation of PH273.   
 You must correctly solve 3 problems in each recitation to get full credit for 
the section. Solving more than 3 problems will c ount for missed 
problems in previous recitation meetings . 
 
Anti-Bias Syllabus Statement: We respect the rights and dignity of each individual and group. We reject 
prejudice and intolerance, and we work to understand differences. We believe that equity and inclusion 
are critical components for campus community memb ers to thrive. If you are a target or a witness of a 
bias incident, you are encouraged to submit a report to the URI Bias Response Team at www.uri.edu/brt . 
There you will also find people and resources to help.  
Disability Services for Students Statement : Your access in this course is important. Please send me 
your Disability Services for Students (DSS) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have 
adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet 
established services through DSS, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about 
the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DSS can be reached by calling: 
401-874-2098, visiting: web.uri.edu/disability , or ema iling: dss@etal.uri.edu . We are available to meet 
with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses.  
Academic Enhancement Center (for undergraduate courses) : Located in Roosevelt Hall, the AEC 
offers free face -to- face and web -based service s to undergraduate students seeking academic support. 
Peer tutoring is available for STEM - related courses by appointment online and in -person. The Writing 
Center offers peer tutoring focused on supporting undergraduate writers at any stage of a writing 
assignment. The UCS160 course and academic skills consultations offer students strategies and 
activities aimed at improving their studying and test -taking skills. Complete details about each of these 
programs, up -to-date schedules, contact information and se lf-service study resources are all available on 
the AEC website, uri.edu/aec .  
COVID -19 Statement:  The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting 
the health and safety of our community. While the university has worked to create a healthy learning 
environment for all, it is up to all of us to ensure our campus stays t hat way.  
As members of the URI community, students are required to comply with standards of conduct and take 
precautions to keep themselves and others safe.  Visit web.uri.edu/coronavirus/  for the  latest information 
about the URI COVID -19 response.  
 
PHY273: LABORATORY AND RECITATION FOR ELEMENTARY PHYSICS I  
 PHY273 is closely connected to PHY203. It consists of two components: 
Laboratory and Recitation. Separate enrollment in each is required.   
 Your recitation grade will be absorbed into your PHY203 grade, but you will be 
getting a separate letter grade for the lab section of PHY273 (1 credit).  
PHY273 Laboratory  
 A statement of Laboratory Policies and the Lab Schedule for the semester is 
provided b elow.  
 A lab manual must be purchased either in advance or at the first lab meeting. 
Please bring an acceptable lab notebook to your first lab meeting. The following 
is the most common, durable and least expensive of its kind we have 
recommended  before : 
National Brand Computation Notebook, Model number 43 -648, 75 sheets with no 
carbon paper.   
 
CONTINUATION OF ELEMENTARY PHYSICS  
 Elementary Physics will continue for two more semesters:  
 PHY204: Electricity and magnetism.  
 PHY205: Thermodynamics, waves, acoustics, optics.  
  
Exam and Homework Schedule  
 
 
 Homework must be submitted to WebAssign by 10 p.m. of the date due.  
 With the problems on WebAssign, some of the numbers and therefore the final 
answers will in general be dif ferent for each student.  
 5 chances are allowed per assignment.  
 After the due date, a 4 day extension with a 10 point penalty  can be selected in 
WebAssign (available once only per assignment).
