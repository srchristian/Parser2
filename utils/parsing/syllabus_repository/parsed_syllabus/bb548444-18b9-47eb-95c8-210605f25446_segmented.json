If the course needs to go remote (due to a weather cancellation, for instance) the lectures will be given asynchronously on Brightspace.\n\nThis course will be taught in person (besides any possible weather related cancellations). However, if there are no further notices, the course will be given asynchronously on Brightspace on the following three dates: November 25th, 27th, December 2nd.",
    "university_wide_policies_resources": "Anti-Bias Syllabus Statement: We respect the rights and dignity of each individual and group. We reject prejudice and intolerance, and we work to understand differences. We believe that equity and inclusion are critical components for campus community members to thrive. If you are a target or a witness of a bias incident, you are encouraged to submit a report to the URI Bias Response Team at www.uri.edu/brt . There you will also find people and resources to help.\n\nDisability Services for Students Statement: Your access in this course is important. Please send me your Disability Services for Students (DSS) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet established services through DSS, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DSS can be reached by calling: 401-874-2098, visiting: web.uri.edu/disability , or emailing: dss@etal.uri.edu . We are available to meet with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses.\n\nAcademic Enhancement Center (for undergraduate courses): Located in Roosevelt Hall, the AEC offers free face-to-face and web-based services to undergraduate students seeking academic support. Peer tutoring is available for STEM-related courses by appointment online and in-person. The Writing Center offers peer tutoring focused on supporting undergraduate writers at any stage of a writing assignment. The UCS160 course and academic skills consultations offer students strategies and activities aimed at improving their studying and test-taking skills. Complete details about each of these programs, up-to-date schedules, contact information and self-service study resources are all available on the AEC website, uri.edu/aec.\n\nCOVID-19 Statement: The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting the health and safety of our community. While the university has worked to create a healthy learning environment for all, it is up to all of us to ensure our campus stays that way.\nAs members of the URI community, students are required to comply with standards of conduct and take precautions to keep themselves and others safe.

    "separate_laboratory_sections": "PHY273: LABORATORY AND RECITATION FOR ELEMENTARY PHYSICS I\nPHY273 is closely connected to PHY203. It consists of two components: Laboratory and Recitation. Separate enrollment in each is required.\nYour recitation grade will be absorbed into your PHY203 grade, but you will be getting a separate letter grade for the lab section of PHY273 (1 credit).\nPHY273 Laboratory\nA statement of Laboratory Policies and the Lab Schedule for the semester is provided below.\nA lab manual must be purchased either in advance or at the first lab meeting. Please bring an acceptable lab notebook to your first lab meeting. The following is the most common, durable and least expensive of its kind we have recommended before:\nNational Brand Computation Notebook, Model number 43-648, 75 sheets with no carbon paper.",
    "recitation_discussion_sections": "Recitation:\n- All students must also register for a recitation section of PHY273. Separate enrollment is required.\n- The recitations will be held in Room 112.\n- Your recitation grade will be counted toward your PHY203 grade up to a maximum of 250 points. There is no separate letter grade for the recitation of PH273.\n- You must correctly solve 3 problems in each recitation to get full credit for the section. Solving more than 3 problems will count for missed problems in previous recitation meetings.",
