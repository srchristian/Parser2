Kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion. (Lec. 3) Pre: credit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and concurrent enrollment in PHY 273. Intended for science and engineering majors. Text: University Physics (Open Stax), 1st Edition, Volume 1 University Physics from Open Stax is a free, open access textbook that can be found at https://openstax.org/subjects/science. Course Goals: 1. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of kinematics. 2. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of forces. 3. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of work, energy, and energy conservation. 4. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of linear momentum and linear momentum conservation. 5. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of rotational kinematics, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum conservation. 6. To develop a conceptual and quantitative understanding of oscillations and simple harmonic motion. General Education Areas: This course satisfies URI's general education areas: \"Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines\" (Full); and \"Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies\" (Partial). Learning Outcomes: 1. To demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics. 2. To apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems. 3. To develop problem-solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics. 4. To be able to carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems. 5. To be able to carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments. Brightspace: The class will use Brightspace for class announcements and all lectures will be posted there. If the course needs to go remote (due to a weather cancellation, for instance) the lectures will be given asynchronously on Brightspace.",
    "schedule": "Course Units: The course is divided into three units as follows: unit #1 Chaps. 1,3,4, unit #2 Chaps. 5-8, unit #3 Chaps. 9-11,15. Lecture Times: 1pm-1:50pm (section 1), (East Hall Auditorium). If there are no further notices, the course will be given asynchronously on Brightspace on the following three dates: November 25th, 27th, December 2nd.

    "assignments": "Homework Assignments: A set of homework problems will be due on or before (usually Wednesdays or Fridays) of almost every week (by 10 p.m.) and will be administered through a web-based system called WebAssign (see below). Exam and Homework Schedule: Homework must be submitted to WebAssign by 10 p.m. of the date due. 5 chances are allowed per assignment. After the due date, a 4-day extension with a 10 point penalty can be selected in WebAssign (available once only per assignment). Homework Schedule: Wed., Sept. 11 HW #1 due Reading: Chapter 1 Wed., Sept. 18 HW #2 due Reading: Sections 3.1-3.5 Wed., Sept. 25 HW #3 due Reading: Sections 2.1-2.3, 4.1-4.3 Fri., Oct. 4 HW #4 due Reading: Chap. 5 Fri., Oct. 11 HW #5 due Reading: Sections 4.4, 6.1-6.3 Fri., Oct. 18 HW #6 due Reading: 1st part of Sec. 2.4, Chap. 7 Fri., Oct. 25 HW #7 due Reading: Chap. 8 Wed., Nov. 6 HW #8 due Wed., Nov. 20 HW #9 due Reading: 2nd part of Sec. 2.4, Secs. 11-11.3 Wed., Nov. 27 HW #10 due Reading: Sections 13.1-13.5 Wed., Dec. 4 HW #11 due Reading: Sections 15.1,15.2,15.4 Wed., Dec. 11 HW #12 due Reading: Sections 15.1,15.2,15.4.",
    "exams": "Examinations: There will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All exams are closed book and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You will be allowed to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam and 3 sheets for the final. A unit exam will be given at the end of each of the first three course units. Exam Dates: unit #1 exam on Fri. 09/27, unit #2 exam on Fri. 10/25, unit #3 exam on Wed., 12/11. Final Exam: Chaps. 1-11,15 TBA. The final exam will consist of 3 parts each corresponding to the 3 unit exams above. If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit exam score when your semester grade is calculated. However, the scores of the final are not replaced if they are lower than the scores of the unit exams.",
