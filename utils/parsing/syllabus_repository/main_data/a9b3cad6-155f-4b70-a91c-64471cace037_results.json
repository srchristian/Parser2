Topics include kinematics and dynamics of particles and systems of particles, conservation laws, rotational motion, gravitation, and oscillatory motion. Prerequisites: Credit or concurrent enrollment in MTH 141 and concurrent enrollment in PHY 273. Intended for science and engineering majors. Textbook: University Physics (OpenStax), 1st Edition, Volume 1. Available at https://openstax.org/subjects/science. General Education Areas: Satisfies URI's general education areas: \"Scientific, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical Disciplines\" (Full); and \"Mathematical, Statistical, or Computational Strategies\" (Partial). Learning Outcomes: 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the basic concepts of classical mechanics. 2. Apply a conceptual understanding of classical mechanics to physics problems. 3. Develop problem-solving strategies and techniques appropriate to classical mechanics. 4. Carry out quantitative solutions of classical mechanics problems. 5. Carry out, analyze, and present the results of classical mechanics laboratory experiments.",
