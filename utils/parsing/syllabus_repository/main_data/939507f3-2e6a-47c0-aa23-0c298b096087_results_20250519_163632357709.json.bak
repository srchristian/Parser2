The course uses Brightspace for announcements and lectures, with some classes possibly given asynchronously. There will be three unit exams and a final exam, all closed book with permitted calculators. Homework is administered via WebAssign. The course is divided into three units with specific chapters and exam dates. The final exam score can replace the unit exam score if higher. Recitation sections are held in Room 112, with a maximum of 250 points contributing to the grade. The course continues into PHY204 and PHY205 in subsequent semesters. Additional policies include lab requirements, make-up labs, and grading scales."
