Brightspace: The class will use Brightspace for class announcements and all lectures will be posted there. If the course needs to go remote (due to a weather cancellation, for instance) the lectures will be given asynchronously on Brightspace. This course will be taught in person (besides any possible weather related cancellations). However, if there are no further notices, the course will be given asynchronously on Brightspace on the following three dates: November 25th, 27th, December 2nd Examinations: There will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All exams are closed book and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You will be allowed to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam and 3 sheets for the final. A unit exam will be given at the end of each of the first three course units. The dates and times are listed below. Course Units: The course is divide d into three units as follows: unit #1 Chaps. 1,3,4 exam on Fri. 09/27 unit #2 Chaps. 5 -8 exam on Fri. 10/25 unit #3 Chaps. 9 -11,15 exam on Wed ., 12/11 Final Exam Chaps. 1 -11,15 tba Final Exam : The final exam will consist of 3 parts each corresponding to the 3 unit exams above. If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit exam score when your semester grade is calculated. However, the scores of the final are not replaced if they are lower than the scores of the unit exams . **If the course has to go remote during the semester, the exam schedule and grading scheme may be modified .** Homework Assignments: A set of homework problems will be due on or before (usually Wednesdays or Fridays) of almost every week ( by 10 p.m. ) and will be administered through a web -based system called WebAssign (see below). Course Grade: The grade for PHY203 will be based on a maximum of 1200 points : unit exams 400 points final exam 400 points homework 150 points recitation 250 points Grading Scheme : A(93 -100); A -(90-93); B+(87 -90); B(83 -87); B -(80-83); C+(77 -80); C(73 -77); C-(70-73); D+(67 -70); D(60 -67); F(<60). WebAssign: Homework and recitations will be administered through a web -based service named WebAssign. WebAssign can be accessed and purchased at http://webassign.net/student.html The Class Key for WebAssign for this course is: uri 1373 1043 A recent check showed that it was cheaper to purchase Webassign/Openstax for 2 semesters, since it will be used for PHY204 as well. Here’s a specific link to openstax/webassign: https://webassign.net/features/textbooks/osuniphys1/details.html . Here’s a link about pricing: https://www.cengage.com/c/webassign -for-openstax - university -physics -1e-ling/9781337799942/?filterBy=Higher -Education#compare -buying - options .  Students will enroll with this class key, creating their own user IDs and password. When they go to the login page, they simply click the box saying "ENTER CLASS KEY".  You will have 5 chances to submit your homework solutions before the due date.  After the due date, a 4 day extension with a 10 point penalty can be selected in WebAssign (available once only per assignment -and must be selected 4 days after the assignment is due ).  In WebAssign each student gets a different set of numbers in the problems, so the answers will be different.  Try logging on well before the first assignment due date and become familiar with the WebAssign system. There is a 2 -week (free) grace period for you to get s tarted. Recitation:  All students must also register for a recitation section of PHY273. Separate enrollment is required .  The recitations will be held in Room 112.  Your recitation grade will be counted toward your PHY203 grade up to a maximum of 250 points . There is no separate letter grade for the recitation of PH273.  You must correctly solve 3 problems in each recitation to get full credit for the section. Solving more than 3 problems will c ount for missed problems in previous recitation meetings . Anti-Bias Syllabus Statement: We respect the rights and dignity of each individual and group. We reject prejudice and intolerance, and we work to understand differences. We believe that equity and inclusion are critical components for campus community memb ers to thrive. If you are a target or a witness of a bias incident, you are encouraged to submit a report to the URI Bias Response Team at www.uri.edu/brt . There you will also find people and resources to help. Disability Services for Students Statement : Your access in this course is important. Please send me your Disability Services for Students (DSS) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet established services through DSS, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DSS can be reached by calling: 401-874-2098, visiting: web.uri.edu/disability , or ema iling: dss@etal.uri.edu . We are available to meet with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses. Academic Enhancement Center (for undergraduate courses) : Located in Roosevelt Hall, the AEC offers free face -to- face and web -based service s to undergraduate students seeking academic support. Peer tutoring is available for STEM - related courses by appointment online and in -person. The Writing Center offers peer tutoring focused on supporting undergraduate writers at any stage of a writing assignment.
