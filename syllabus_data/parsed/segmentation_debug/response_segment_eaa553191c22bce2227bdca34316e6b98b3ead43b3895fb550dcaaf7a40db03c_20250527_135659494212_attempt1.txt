  "assignments_exams": "Examinations: There will be three unit exams and a cumulative final exam. All exams are closed book and no other resources are allowed. Calculators will be permitted. You will be allowed to bring a sheet of paper containing relevant formulas for each unit exam and 3 sheets for the final. A unit exam will be given at the end of each of the first three course units. The dates and times are listed below.\nCourse Units: The course is divide d into three units as follows:\nunit #1 Chaps. 1,3,4 exam on Fri. 09/27\nunit #2 Chaps. 5 -8 exam on Fri. 10/25\nunit #3 Chaps. 9 -11,15 exam on Wed ., 12/11\nFinal Exam Chaps. 1 -11,15 tba\nFinal Exam: The final exam will consist of 3 parts each corresponding to the 3 unit exams above. If the score on a part of the final exam is higher than the score on the corresponding unit exam, the score on that section of the final exam will replace the unit exam score when your semester grade is calculated. However, the scores of the final are not replaced if they are lower than the scores of the unit exams.",
  "course_schedule": "Homework Assignments: A set of homework problems will be due on or before (usually Wednesdays or Fridays) of almost every week ( by 10 p.m. ) and will be administered through a web -based system called WebAssign (see below). Course Grade: The grade for PHY203 will be based on a maximum of 1200 points : unit exams 400 points final exam 400 points homework 150 points recitation 250 points Grading Scheme : A(93 -100); A -(90-93); B+(87 -90); B(83 -87); B -(80-83); C+(77 -80); C(73 -77); C-(70-73); D+(67 -70); D(60 -67); F(<60). WebAssign: Homework and recitations will be administered through a web -based service named WebAssign. WebAssign can be accessed and purchased at http://webassign.net/student.html The Class Key for WebAssign for this course is: uri 1373 1043 A recent check showed that it was cheaper to purchase Webassign/Openstax for 2 semesters, since it will be used for PHY204 as well. Here’s a specific link to openstax/webassign: https://webassign.net/features/textbooks/osuniphys1/details.html . Here’s a link about pricing: https://www.cengage.com/c/webassign -for-openstax - university -physics -1e-ling/9781337799942/?filterBy=Higher -Education#compare -buying - options . Students will enroll with this class key, creating their own user IDs and password. When they go to the login page, they simply click the box saying \"ENTER CLASS KEY\". You will have 5 chances to submit your homework solutions before the due date. After the due date, a 4 day extension with a 10 point penalty can be selected in WebAssign (available once only per assignment -and must be selected 4 days after the assignment is due ). In WebAssign each student gets a different set of numbers in the problems, so the answers will be different. Try logging on well before the first assignment due date and become familiar with the WebAssign system. There is a 2 -week (free) grace period for you to get s tarted. Recitation: All students must also register for a recitation section of PHY273. Separate enrollment is required . The recitations will be held in Room 112. Your recitation grade will be counted toward your PHY203 grade up to a maximum of 250 points . There is no separate letter grade for the recitation of PH273. You must correctly solve 3 problems in each recitation to get full credit for the section. Solving more than 3 problems will c ount for missed problems in previous recitation meetings.",
